                <h2 data-aos="fade">Where did it come from? Who created it? How has it changed over time?</h2>
                <p>
                    Falcon is an AI language model devloped by Technology Innovation Institue(TII), located in Abu Dhabi, UAE. It was built by TII's AI and Digital Science Research Center, which was being backed by the Advanced Technology Research Conncil(ATRC), an Abu Dhabi Government entity responible for shaping advanced research and development for technology in Abu Dhabi. Over time Falcon has seen many different models, it's first being Falcon 1-40B, which released in 2023. It was trained on 1 trillion tokens(a token is a unit of data, so you can imagine that 1 trillion is quite a lot of data) and out preformed many models of that time. Falcon kept growing with models like Falcon 1-180B, Falcon 2-11B, and Falcon 2-11B VLM until we reach today's model, Falcon 3-10B, which was trained on 14 trillion tokens and ranked #1 gobally for models under 13B parameters, this model has since been the base for Falcon Arabic(an Arabic specific model) and potential future models.

                <h2 data-aos="fade">What’s it used for?</h2>
                <p>Large language models like Falcon are generally used for understanding human text, to which they'll provide with an answer. Common uses for large language models include summarizing text, providing information, writing text, common conversation, etc.</p>

            <div>
                <h2 data-aos="fade">How does it work? (in general)</h2>
                <p>Falcon along with other AI is able to understand and generate human-like text because it is fed huge data-sets, which they use to learn languages and give information.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 data-aos="fade">What are its strengths?</h2>
                <p>Falcons strengths lies in it's ability to understand Arabic of all forms, while already being a difficult language, it's able to understand modern Arabic all the way to Arabic dialects. Other than Falcon specific strengths, it's also able to perform multiple different tasks, has a broad range of knowledge, and provides human-like interactions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 data-aos="fade">What are its weaknesses?</h2>
                <p>Falcons weaknesses are mostly it's inablility to understand many languages, potential bias based on the data given to it, and competition with new models that outperform Falcon with new features.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 data-aos="fade">What are the costs to use it? Are there any other costs?</h2>
                <p>Falcon is free to use and open source, however there are costs for the developers who need devlope the AI as well as hardware to host it.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 data-aos="fade">What positive impacts does it have on society?</h2>
                <p>Falcon provides a large language model that is easily accessible to Arabic speaking groups who may have issues with other models that aren't as fluent in that language. It also helps speed productivity, where instead of spending unnecessary time researching information, you can ask the chat bot for information in a few seconds.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 data-aos="fade">What negative impacts does it have on society?</h2>
                <p>Because of how AI is ment to do things better than humans can, they're likely to replace many jobs and maybe entire industies, which may leave many people unempolyed. Another problem is that it'll contain biases that may be negative towards peoples culture, race, identity, etc.

                <h2 data-aos="fade">Examples of its output</h2>
                <p>
                    Prompt: Write me a short poem about the ocean<br>
                    <br>
                    Output: Waves whisper secrets to the shore,<br>
                    Silver tides that rise and roar.<br>
                    Sunlight dances on the deep,<br>
                    Where the restless waters sleep.<br>
                    <br>
                    Salt and spray upon the breeze,<br>
                    Carried softly through the trees.<br>
                    Endless blue, both calm and wild,<br>
                    Nature’s heart, untamed and mild.
